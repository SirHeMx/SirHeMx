This site was made for a friend who was running the joke that she was running for president against Donald Trump and Sleepy Joe Biden. This read me will also contain a guide to the site.
When you start the site you see some buttons. Before the alpha v1 was released they were just hyperlinks. We added buttons on every page except for the footer which we added in a later version.
The original version was just a hyperlink that said that you voted. Alpha v1 was released and brought the buttons, submit screen, contact form, and more to the site for added functionality.
I am currently working mainly on this project and two others. My main focus is on this one until Jazmyne is happy with the end result. 
Once that is done I will focus more on the Visual Basic/Blueprint game called card fight (On my github profile) as well as a HTML5 Rhythm game that is just formatted correctly in the code editor without any actual code to make the site. 
All of this including my itch.io profile which is being updated all the time with my game library.
Anyway, this is the literal index(.html) of the site. There are not too many files as this is not too advanced.

There are a couple of CSS files, but its mainly HTML as that is the only language that is website related that I know. I only know HTML, not CSS, and some JS.
